# IMPACT! — A FAIR and FMVA Financial Simulator

An interactive educational tool that demonstrates how FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) and FMVA (Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst) concepts work together to quantify IT security risk in financial terms through scenario-based simulation.

## Overview

IMPACT! is designed as a showpiece for both sides of the risk coin—FAIR and FMVA—with scenario-based play as the glue between them. This educational tool helps users learn how FAIR and FMVA concepts work together so you can understand IT security risk in financial terms.

**Features:**
- 15 interactive security scenarios with real-world IT security incidents
- FAIR risk analysis (loss event frequency, loss magnitude, Monte Carlo simulations)
- FMVA financial modeling (3-statement models, DCF valuations, capital budgeting)
- Interactive decision-making that affects risk exposure and financial outcomes
- Geographic context with 3D globe visualization
- In-app FMVA spreadsheet for hands-on financial modeling
